# learning-python
Scripts I've written while learning python. Perhaps these will help other students.
I've made these publicly available so that future students or people wanting to learn python can use them as referance/starting points. I do not intend to enable smart@$$'s to cheat their way through their program classes. Most of these scripts are commented nicely to explain what's going on.
